# CLAUDE.md — unionai-docs / unionai-docs-infra

This file provides guidance for working with the Union.ai documentation repositories.

> **There are two copies of this file and they have drifted.** `unionai-docs/CLAUDE.md` and
> `unionai-docs-infra/CLAUDE.md` were meant to be the same file. They are not: the parent's copy
> carries two sections this one lacks (self-managed context, and the API-reference autolinking
> rules). Treat the **parent's copy as the fuller one** for content authoring, and this one as
> the build-infrastructure view. Check both before trusting either. Reconciling them is tracked
> in DOC-1530.

## Project Overview

Multi-variant Hugo documentation site for Flyte (open-source) and Union.ai products. A single source generates two variants:
- **flyte** — Open-source Flyte orchestration platform
- **union** — Union.ai commercial product (covers both BYOC and Self-managed deployments)

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development (requires hugo.local.toml setup first)
cp hugo.local.toml~sample hugo.local.toml  # First time only
make dev                                    # Start dev server at localhost:1313

# Production build
make dist                                   # Build all variants to dist/
make serve PORT=4444                        # Serve dist/ locally

# Examples submodule
make init-examples                          # Initialize unionai-examples
make update-examples                        # Update to latest

# API documentation regeneration
make -f unionai-docs-infra/Makefile.api.sdk              # SDK API + CLI docs
make -f unionai-docs-infra/Makefile.api.plugins          # Plugin API docs

# Validation
make check-images                           # Validate image references
make check-jupyter                          # Validate Jupyter notebooks
make validate-urls                          # Check for broken URLs
```

## Repository Layout

The repo separates **version-specific content/config** (top level) from **shared build infrastructure** (`unionai-docs-infra/`):

**Top level** — files that differ between `main` (v2) and `v1` branches:
- `makefile.inc` — VERSION, VARIANTS
- `api-packages.toml` — API package registry
- `content/`, `data/`, `linkmap/`, `include/` — Content and generated data

**`unionai-docs-infra/`** — shared build infrastructure (identical across branches).
**Policy (DOC-1329): content is versioned; chrome is promoted.** Cut tags snapshot content only;
builds wrap every version tree (latest, stable, all pins) in the infra named by the *branch tip's*
submodule pointer. Infra/theme changes ship via a pointer bump — never a cut; the pin inside a tag
is provenance only. Details: `unionai-docs-infra/VERSIONING.md`.
- `Makefile` — Real build logic (top-level Makefile forwards to this)
- `hugo.toml`, `hugo.site.toml`, `hugo.ver.toml`, `config.{variant}.toml` — Hugo config
- `static/` — Shared static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `scripts/` — Build shell scripts
- `tools/` — Python build tools
- `layouts/` — Hugo templates, partials, shortcodes
- `themes/` — Hugo theme
- `redirects.csv` — Redirect data

## Hugo Configuration Chain

Configs merge in order:
1. `unionai-docs-infra/hugo.toml` — Core settings (directory remapping for layouts, etc.)
2. `hugo.site.toml` — Site-wide settings (version-specific)
3. `unionai-docs-infra/hugo.ver.toml` — Version definitions
4. `unionai-docs-infra/config.{variant}.toml` — Variant-specific settings
5. `hugo.local.toml` — Local dev overrides (not committed)

## Variant System

### Page-level variants

Every page MUST declare which variants it appears in via frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Page
weight: 3
variants: +flyte +union
---
```

- `+` includes, `-` excludes
- All variants must be explicitly listed (no defaults)

### Content-level variants

```markdown
{{< variant union >}}
{{< markdown >}}
This appears only in the Union variant.
{{< /markdown >}}
{{< /variant >}}
```

**Hugo quirk**: Inside container shortcodes, wrap Markdown content with `{{< markdown >}}`.

### Variant keys

For inline text that varies by variant:

```markdown
The {{< key product_name >}} platform...
```

Keys defined in `hugo.site.toml` under `[params.key]`. Common keys: `product_name`, `product_full_name`, `cli`, `kit_name`, `kit_remote`, `docs_home`.

## Key Shortcodes

- `{{< variant ... >}}` — Variant-conditional content
- `{{< key ... >}}` — Product name replacements
- `{{< docs_home {variant} >}}` — Doc root links (required for cross-doc links)
- `{{< tabs >}}` / `{{< tab >}}` — Tabbed content
- `{{< code file="..." fragment=name lang=python >}}` — Code inclusion from external files
- `{{< link-card >}}` — Clickable cards
- `{{< py_class_ref class.name >}}` — Python API refs

Fragments in source files:
```python
# {{docs-fragment name}}
code here
# {{/docs-fragment}}
```

Examples at: `http://localhost:1313/__docs_builder__/shortcodes/` (dev mode only)

## Page Settings (Frontmatter)

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
weight: 3              # Lower weight = higher in nav
variants: +flyte ...   # Variant visibility (all must be listed)
top_menu: true         # Makes this a top tab
sidebar_expanded: true # Expands section by default
toc_max: 3             # Max heading level in TOC
mermaid: true          # Enable Mermaid diagrams
---
```

Navigation: lower `weight` = higher position. `weight: 0` or missing = alphabetical at end.

## Content Authoring

### Notices

```markdown
> [!NOTE] Title
> Content here

> [!WARNING] Title
> Warning content
```

### Python example pages

```yaml
---
layout: py_example
example_file: /path/to/file.py
run_command: union run --remote path/to/file.py main
source_location: https://github.com/unionai/unionai-examples/tree/main/path
---
```

### Jupyter notebooks

```yaml
---
jupyter_notebook: /path/to/notebook.ipynb
---
```

## Development Setup

1. Install Hugo (extended) at the pinned version in `unionai-docs-infra/.hugoversion` (currently 0.161.1): `brew install hugo`
2. Copy config: `cp hugo.local.toml~sample hugo.local.toml`
3. Run: `make dev`

Dev settings in `hugo.local.toml`:
```toml
variant = "union"          # Active variant
show_inactive = true       # Show other variants grayed out
highlight_active = true    # Highlight active variant content
highlight_keys = true      # Show key replacements
```

## Build Constraints

- Pre-build checks block absolute URLs to union.ai/docs — use `{{< docs_home {variant} >}}` instead
- Hugo version must be >= the pin in `unionai-docs-infra/.hugoversion` (currently 0.161.1). **The floor equals the pin** so local dev and CI build with the same Hugo; `pre-flight.sh` fails below it and warns above it (brew tracks latest, so running ahead of CI is the common skew and the one a floor cannot catch).
- Python >= 3.10 required for the build tools (`requires-python` in
  `unionai-docs-infra/pyproject.toml`); CI runs 3.12

## API Documentation

Generated from Python packages using `tools/api_generator`:
- Build with `make -f unionai-docs-infra/Makefile.api.sdk` or `Makefile.api.plugins`
- Respects `__all__` in packages
- Ignores `_` prefixed items and imports (unless in `__all__`)

## Redirects

Managed in `unionai-docs-infra/redirects.csv` and **deployed automatically**, not by hand. The
`deploy-redirects.yml` workflow in `unionai-docs` pushes the whole list to Cloudflare on
`workflow_dispatch` and on pushes to `main` or `v1` that touch the infra pointer or
`versions.toml`.

Two things to know before adding a row:

- **Retired version pins need no row.** Their redirects are derived at deploy time from the
  `retired` list in each line's `versions.toml`. A test fails if you add one (DOC-1497).
- **`redirects.csv` cannot do patterns.** It becomes a Cloudflare Bulk Redirect List, which has
  no regex and no capture groups. Pattern redirects live in the zone's dynamic redirect ruleset,
  edited in the dashboard.

Full picture, including the three fallback catch-alls and content negotiation:
`unionai-docs-infra/ROUTING-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## LLM Documentation Pipeline

The build generates, for each variant:

- **`<path>.md`** — a clean Markdown twin of every page, served at the page's own URL with `.md`
  appended. A section landing page's twin ends with a `## Subpages` list, which makes it the
  index for its section. Each twin opens with an identity block naming the product and version
  line.
- **`llms.txt`** — the page index, with H2/H3 headings per entry.
- **`llms-full.txt`** — the whole variant as one file.

**One shape: `<path>.md`.** The older names `page.md`, `section.md` and `_section.md` are retired
and no longer generated; Cloudflare 301s them to the page twin. Do not describe them as current.

Readers and agents also reach a twin by sending `Accept: text/markdown` to the ordinary page URL.
Details: `unionai-docs-infra/README.md` and the LLM-optimized documentation page in the docs.
